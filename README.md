# intensive-project
For my intensive project, I made a page based off something that could (and hopefully will) be invented in the future, The Delivery Drone! On this webpage, I made a wesbite that would be promoting the delivery drone when it first comes out in the future, and how it would look like in it's first few months or so.
## Welcome Message
First, I made a welcome message, greeting the viewers who came to the website to check out the drone. The background here is colored sky blue, to make it look like the sky, where drones travel across.
## Mixture of Three Things
Next, I made a mixture section, where I said the three things that this product is a mixture of. A box, a drone, and mail. When you mix these three things together, you get the delivery drone! The background here is like a building with three windows, since this is something that flies across above buildings as well.
## What the Delivery Drone is
After that, I made a message saying what the delivery drone is. I explained all of it's amazing qualities it has above regular drones and normal delivery, like long-lasting battery and further distances. I also added how the delivery drone looks like at the bottom, which is the concept of this idea.
## Inspiration
Then, I added a grassy green ground background for a special part of the page, the inspiration! This is where I talk about what inspired me to make this product, and how it came to be. Long story short, I had many experiences with both deliveries and my brother flying his drone, so there we go!
## Place an Order
Finally, at the bottom, with a wooden tan background, is where people make their deliveries at! All they do is type their name, their email address, their home address for wherever they want their package delivered to, and what they would like to purchase! When they press submit, their package is notified by the owners of the delivery drone, and start sending the package to them!
